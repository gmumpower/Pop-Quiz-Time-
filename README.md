This project consisted of creating a basic quiz for staying on top of current web development knowledge. 

The Rules

-The user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz
-Every time the user selects an answer:
    A message tells them if the answer was correct/incorrect
    If the answer was incorrect, 10 seconds is deducted from the timer
-The game ends once the timer hits 0 or the user answers all the questions
Scoring

-The user may save their score to their local storage by entering their initials
-All the saved scores can be viewed on the highscores page
